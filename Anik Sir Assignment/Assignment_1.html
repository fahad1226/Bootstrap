		<p><strong>Education</strong> is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators and also learners may also educate themselves.[1] Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
	    Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
	    A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[2] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.

	    Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[5] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

      <p>Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society.In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.

     <p>In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.

       After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe.[11] The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.[6] </p>
       <p><strong>During the High Middle Ages,</strong> Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers,including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford.
